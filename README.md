## Update Moved repository


Initially, I chose the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js) for this project as I was keen on learning Angular. Having prior familiarity with Express and Node.js, I believed it would streamline the development process. However, as I delved deeper, I observed that the unopinionated nature of Express, coupled with my burgeoning backend development expertise, occasionally led to suboptimal design decisions.

Seeking to broaden my skillset and evolve as a developer, I decided to transition to a more robust backend framework—Spring Boot. This change also presented an opportunity to transition from NoSQL (MongoDB) to a SQL-based database, enriching my understanding of different database paradigms.

As I engaged with Angular, I found myself increasingly drawn to the React approach to front-end development. I appreciate the learning curve with Angular, which has provided me a solid foundation. However, I resonate more with the philosophies and methodologies encapsulated in React. Hence, I've decided to revert to React for the front-end aspect of this project. This shift aligns with my preference and the industry’s trending affinity towards React, while also ensuring that I am well-equipped to work with Angular should future projects necessitate it.
